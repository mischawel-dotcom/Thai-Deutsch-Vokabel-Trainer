## Development Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this process when making changes:**

1. **Develop & Test Locally**
   - Use `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0` during development
   - Actively test changes as you make them

2. **Preview Build Test**
   - Run `npm run preview -- --host 0.0.0.0` before committing
   - Ensure the production build works correctly

3. **Commit to Git**
   - Only commit after both dev and preview testing pass
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages

4. **Push to GitHub**
   - Push only tested, stable code
   - Never skip the preview step
